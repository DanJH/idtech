# first we are going to create a variable
# this variable will be what we will edit
newString = "This is a test string, enter a name to remember"

# will output the new string
print(newString)

# setting the variable to input() will allow you to input into the string
newString = input()
# it will wait until something is typed and pressed enter before moving on 

# will output edited string
# using a comma outputs multiple things with a space in between
print(newString, "is learning Python")

# we can make new variables and input into them using a prompt
# this prompt is something that goes in between the () in input
name = input("Insert some name to remember")
