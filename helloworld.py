# variables are formed or more specifically defined by creating a name and setting it equal to something:
floatTest=123.123

# otherwise they can be spread out like this! (this is preferred)
stringTest = "Hi this is a variable, notice my quotation marks!"
# a string is like the one above, it holds english charachters, words, and sentences

# booleans are variables that are either true or false
booleanTest = False
# note that booleans must be False or True (WITH CAPITAL FIRST LETTER!!!)

# we can make it print a message when ran using
print(floatTest)
# if we want to print text we must use quotation marks
print("test stuff to print")

# we can quit the program by making it
exit()
