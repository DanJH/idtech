# variables are formed or more specifically defined by creating a name and setting it equal to something:
testVariable=123
# otherwise they can be spread out like this! (this is preferred)

# we can make it print a message when ran using
print(newVariable)
# if we want to print text we must use quotation marks
print("test stuff to print")

# we can quit the program by making it
